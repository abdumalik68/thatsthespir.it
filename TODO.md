- quote for Mailchimp
- RSS Feed
- XML Sitemap
- All Authors route
- add optional fields to routes, as URL Parameters (ex: author/all?fields=quotes,total)
- User Authentication via Hybridauth

- Suggest a quote feature
- if author does not exist, make sure author is created before quote
- Fix script:
  - [x] update all quote->slug
  - recalculate all author->total
- use slug instead of ID
